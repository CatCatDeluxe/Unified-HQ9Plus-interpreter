## Notes and Issues

- The 2d mode is not yet implemented, this would require a partial rewrite of the parsing code that I'm too lazy to do.
- In brainfuck mode you can create inescapable infinite loops, like so: `+[,]` You can't exit it, as far as I know...
- The source code showing command outputs `source-code-not-available` when running the executable.
